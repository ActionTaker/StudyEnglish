# Challenges for the intercultural couple
Having different lifestyle and background is potentially problematic to all marriages, not just to inter-cultural ones. However, it is the degree to which they exist that is not the same. In inter-cultural marriages, the differences are often extreme or more dramatic. They involve cultural identity and thereby are unconscious and more difficult to resolve. And the more different the cultures, the more difficult the job.  
Some couples insist that cultural differences are not issues at all if two people are truly in love. This does not mean they are not issues. It usually means that these couple haven't thought about or don't see these differences as cultural issues, that they didn't cause the couple problems, that the couple has somehow managed to overcome or resolve these areas of difference without being aware of what they were doing, or that in their particular personal/cultural mix, certain differences were unimportant or even nonexistent. Or it may mean that they had so much else going for them in common interests, goals, and complementary personalities that they simply slid past the cultural hurdles. But generally speaking, cultural differences do indeed exist, and many pose challenges for the inter-cultural couple.
